Implement the simplest task scheduling system using design patterns. It should be possible to create a to-do list,
set priorities, set up
dates of completion, deletion and change of cases.
Each case can be tagged. To-do list can be downloaded and saved to file. It is necessary to realize the opportunity
search for a specific case. Search criteria: by date, by tag, by
priority and so on.
