Task 1
Create a program using the Pattern Observer. Subject of observation - the dollar rate (or euro). 
Observers - clients (bank, broker). With an increase (decrease) in the rate, observers sell (buy) currency.
Task 2.
Make an ATM program (issuing money). At the beginning of the program, a certain number of bills of every 
denomination is downloaded to the ATM. Let the ATM issue bills in denominations of UAH 100, UAH 50, UAH 20. 
and 5 UAH The client comes to the ATM with a request for a certain amount of money. The program should give an 
answer on the possibility of issuing such amount (it is desirable to add in addition how many bills were used to pay the sum).
After servicing a certain customer, the number of corresponding (issued) banknotes decreases.
Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern.
