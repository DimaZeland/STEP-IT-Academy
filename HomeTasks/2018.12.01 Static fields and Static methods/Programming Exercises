Task 1
Create a Class A Student with Fields
- last name (dynamic field)
- the number of ratings
- estimates (dynamic array of ratings)
- maximum and minimum valid ratings (static class constants)
Identify methods
- Designer (s)
- copy designer
- destructor
- The method of student information output
- access methods (getters, setters) to the field name
- method of access (getter) to the number of subjects (grades)
- method of placement (correction) of a student's assessment for a particular subject (check the correctness of the rating number (subject) and the assessment itself)

Task 2.
Create a water reservoir with fields
- name
- Type of reservoirs (lake, sea, etc.), preferably enum
- width
- length
- maximum depth
- static field of the number of reservoirs
By methods
- default constructor;
- designer with parameters;
- access methods (getters / setters);
- definition of approximate volume (width * length * maximum depth);
- determination of the area of ​​the water surface (volume (width * length);
- Static logical method of checking whether two reservoirs belong to the same type (sea-sea; lake-lake);
- static method for comparing the area of ​​the water surface: the method returns 1, if the first reservoir of a larger area, the method returns -1, if the first reservoir of a smaller area, 0 reservoirs of the same area.
- static method of finding in the array of reservoirs the largest area of ​​the reservoir of the specified type

Check the class work.
