Task 1
Fill the Fibonacci Container (vector, deck, etc.) using the generate () and lambda algorithm.

Task 2.
Create a program that creates the set of C ++ words (if, switch, ...) encountered in a text file with the C ++ program.


Task 3
To write the program "Automated information system of the railway station". The system contains: 
information about the departure of trains. For each train indicate: number, departure time, destination station. Provide:
o Data entry into the system (or download from the file);
o Supplementing the system with new data;
o Output information about all trains at the user's choice (as numbers grow, in direction or at departure time);
o Information about a specific train (find_if);
o Removing trains from the system
Use vector (deck), iterators, algorithms, lambda.

Task 4.
There is a file with data about the names of countries and cities. Implement a program that will allow
upload data from file
save data to file
look for cities in a specific country,
replace the name of the city
add cities and countries
delete cities and countries,
count the number of cities,
display country list.
Â When programming an application, be sure to use the lambda mechanism.
Use the map <> or multimap <> to choose from
