It is necessary to create a third array of the minimum possible size, in which it is necessary to collect elements of both arrays.
Assignment 4:
Two arrays are given: A [M] and B [N] (M and N are entered from the keyboard). 
It is necessary to create a third array of the minimum possible size, in which it is necessary to collect common elements of two arrays without repetitions.
