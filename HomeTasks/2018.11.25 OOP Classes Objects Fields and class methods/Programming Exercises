Task 1
Write a class "Account", which contains:
•	Account number
• The amount of funds on the account
• The name of the currency of the account (dollars, hryvnia, euros, etc.), for which you can use one symbol: G, E, $ or counting type value, etc.
Provide an opportunity:
• Open an account and initially deposit money into an account (by default, open the account in UAH)
• To withdraw money from the account
• Make money on the account
NOTE! On 12 points also realize the possibility to transfer money from one account to another. Note that accounts may be in different currencies.

Task 2.
Create an Int class that mimics the work of the standard int type.
For example, let the code of the main program (in the function main ()) for the built-in int type looks like this:
// using variables of the standard type int
int a = 8, b = 3, res = 0;
res = a + b;
res = a / b;
co << res << эndl;
// using objects of type Int, the similar code will have the form
Int a (8), b (3), res; // res: [0]
res = a.sum (b); // res: [11]
com << res.getValue () << enndl; // 11
res = a.div (b); // res: [2]
com << res.getValue () << enndl; // 2
The only field of this class should be int.
Create
• Designers (by default and with one parameter)
• Methods for accessing the class field
• Method for outputting values ​​to the screen
• The method of adding an Int instance to another instance of the Int class (for example, the summation may be performed by the prototype Int Sum (const Int & num)).
• The method of subtracting from the given instance of the Int class another instance of the Int class
• The method of multiplying this instance of the Int class for another instance of the Int class
• The method of dividing this instance of the Int class into another instance of the Int class (note that division by 0 is not possible)
Write the program in which will create three objects of class Int, two of which will be initialized. Add two initialized objects, assign a result to a third, and then display the result on the screen.
NOTE! For 12 points, also implement a method that performs a similar operation * =.
