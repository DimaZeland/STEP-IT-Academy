OOP Inheritance. Manage access by inheritance. The order of calling constructors and destructors during inheritance. Multiple inheritance. 
Conflicts with multiple inheritance. Virtual base class.

Task 1
o Identify the Passport class, which will contain passport information on a citizen of Ukraine (name, serial number and number).
o Use the inheritance mechanism to implement the ForeignPassport class (passport) as a derivative of Passport. 
The passport contains, except for passport data, also information about all issued visas. 
The issued visas can be stored as an array (dynamic array) or a vector (vector <Visa> all). 
Provide for the possibility of adding new passport visas.
o Visa (class or structure) contains the name of the country and the date of validity of the visa.
Test classes.


Task 2a.
Determine the required hierarchy of classes using multiple inheritance. Think of the type of imitation.
Vehicle (manufacturer, maximum speed)
| |
                         The car (number of doors) The ship (number of turbines)
\ /
Amphibian
Amphibia will have 2 names (the first - inherited from the class of the Machine, the second - from the class ship)

Task 2b.
Use the virtual base class to solve the problem of duplicating fields from the base class Vehicle in the Amphibian class.
