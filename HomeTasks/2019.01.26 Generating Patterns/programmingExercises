Task 1. Prototype.
Demonstrate the creation of different types of weapons for some game (you can supplement the task of units). The program defines an array of weapon objects (prototypes). Apply Pattern Prototype.
Task 2. Adapter
Create a Car class with methods Start (), Stop (), Left (int angle), Right (int angle).
Adapt the Car class to the Console Console (CarConsole) interface.

The CarConsole interface offers the methods Stop (), Run (), Rotate (int angle), where angle is the angle of the car, the negative angle means the left turn, the positive - the turn to the right.
Create a Driver class that can manage the car with the control console. That is, the Driver can operate an arbitrary vehicle that supports the CarConsole interface.
