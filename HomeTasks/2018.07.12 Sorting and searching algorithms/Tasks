Sorting and searching algorithms

Create an array. Using the user interface (menus) and previously studied algorithms to realize the ability to:
Menu 1
- Fill an array with random numbers
- Fill the array manually
Menu2.
- Sort Array:
1. Sorting by insertion
a. On growth
b. By recession
2. Sorted by choice
a. On growth
b. By recession
3. Sorting the bubble
a. On growth
b. By recession
4. Sort by shaker
a. On growth
b. By recession
5. Go back
- Find an item:
1. Algorithm of binary search (if the array is not sorted, then ask to first sort it)
2. Algorithm of the linear vocation (overburden)
3. Go back
- Go back
